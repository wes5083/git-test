Practice 1. Git basics.
Part 1. The Git command line. Make sure you have entered your username and email in the Git configuration.
Create a local repository on your own computer. Save three text files to the repository
with the Commit command, the file names or content do not matter.
Once you have saved the files, make a small change to each file. How do you select the files
that are the target of the next commit? Consider a situation where, for example, you want to save one
file in one commit and two in an another. What Git commands do you need?
Find out how to view the version control history and how to compare file versions with each other.
Finally, find out where Git stores the repository's historical data.

Part 2. Visual Studio Code and Git. Open the local folder where
your Git repository (repo) is with Visual Studio Code. Use the File/Open Folder command.
Find out from which Visual Studio Code view you can see the Git version control situation. How does the view differ from what
you see on the command line with the "git status" command?
Edit all three files and add a new one. How can you choose which files will be saved
with the next Commit command? Make 1-3 new commits through the Visual Studio Code interface.
Where in the Visual Studio Code interface can you find the file change history? And how can you compare
file versions?

Bonus: create an account and repo on the GitHub service. How can you upload the
repo on your computer to this cloud service?
